# Big-Data-Pyspark-2020-TracFone-Wireless-Hackathon
Led a team to achieve the 4th place among 22 teams (testing AUC of 1st-4th group: 0.980, 0.971, 0.960, 0.952); Leveraged Spark, Python, and Git to apply tree models to predict Active vs. Inactive customers

Data:

The data belongs to Trachack Wireless, it is confidential, the code just contains the model structure.

Main steps:
    *feature selections
    *data cleaning and encode
    *model fitting and comparing
    *feature importance
    *tuning parameters
    *private and public testing

Main conclusion:

random forest is more robust than xgboosting model, it has better performance in the noisy testing data.
